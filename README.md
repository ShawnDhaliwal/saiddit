### What has been done
1. Simple layout
2. Sign up capability
3. Log in capability
4. Basic error checking for sign up and log in forms. Check if all fields are filled out when logging in or signing up. Check if username is already taken when signing up.
5. Passwords are hashed before being entered into database using sha265


### What needs to be done
1. Everything other than what is mentioned above. See project pdf.
2. [NEEDS FIXING] Log in and Sign up buttons sometimes need to be pressed twice for them to register. Sometimes page needs to be refreshed for   buttons to work.
3. Layout is buggy at some spots. You will notice this if you try to edit the style.css file.
