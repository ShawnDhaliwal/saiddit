Using Bootstrap, Jquery, Javascript, PHP, CSS, HTML, MySQL
Note: You will have to download and install sweetalert for this to run properly.
### What has been done
1. UI layout using HTML, CSS, Jquery, and Bootstrap
2. Sign up capability
3. Log in capability
4. Basic error checking for sign up and log in forms. Check if all fields are filled out when logging in or signing up. Check if username is already taken when signing up.
5. Passwords are hashed before being entered into database using sha265
6. Users can add friends and remove friends. Basic error checking included such as checking for invalid user names and checking if user is actually in friends list when trying to remove. User can not add a friend that is already added in their friends list
7. Users can view friends they have added
8. When a user signs up, they are automatically subscribed to the default subsaiddits
9. Users can view a list of subsaiddits they are subscribed to
10. Basic design of subsaiddit pages. Subsaiddits still need to be filled. Should be done soon.
11. Users can create subsaiddits. Users automaticlly subscribe to subsaiddits they have created.
12. Users can subscribe to subsaiddits they choose
13. Users can create posts and delete a post. If logged in, home page shows posts only from subscribed subsaiddits. If not logged in, home page shows posts from all subsaiddits. 


### What needs to be done
1. Everything other than what is mentioned above. See project pdf.
2. [Would be nice if fixed] Buttons need to be pressed twice for them to register. Sometimes page needs to be refreshed for   buttons to work.
3. Layout is buggy at some spots. You will notice this if you try to edit the style.css file.
4. [FIXED] A list of all subsaiddits appears between the navigation bar and tabs. Not good. Can't figure out why, makes no sense. This list should only appear in a popup. LESSON LEARNED: NEVER USE JQUERY MOBILE FOR DESKTOP WEB DEVELOPMENT, BUT TOO LATE NOW WE KEEP IT
